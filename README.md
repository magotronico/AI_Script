# Instagram Reel Script Generator Based on User Speech Patterns

## Overview

This project aims to generate Instagram Reel scripts by mimicking someone's way of talking through prompt engineering and actual videos from Instagram. Originally designed for a summer camp, the script can be modified for other uses by adjusting the prompt in `generate_new_script.py`.

## Purpose

This mini-project captures the speaking style of an individual to create a new script for an Instagram Reel. Instead of training a model, prompt engineering is used for simplicity and demonstration purposes. For more specialized use cases, training a custom model is recommended. This project showcases the use, power, and application of generative AI.

## Getting Started

1. **Select Instagram Reels**: Choose the reels and get their URLs.
2. **Update Video List**: Paste the URLs into the `videos` list in the script.
3. **Install Required Libraries**: Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the Script**: Execute the main function to generate a new script.
